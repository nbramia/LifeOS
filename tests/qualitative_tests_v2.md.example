## Issues Found & Fixes Applied

### Observations (No Immediate Fixes Required)

1. **Relationship origin queries** (Test 6.3)
   - Current: Routes to people + vault
   - Ideal: Also calendar + gmail for "first interaction" context
   - Severity: Low - current response still useful

2. **Action items routing** (Test 3.1)
   - Current: Routes to vault only
   - Ideal: Dedicated actions source + vault
   - Severity: Low - vault finds action items via semantic search

3. **Vague recall queries** (Test 6.2)
   - Current: Routes to vault only
   - Ideal: Broader search across Drive + Gmail
   - Severity: Low - vault semantic search is effective

### Summary

The routing system performs well across diverse query types:
- **Multi-person queries:** Excellent (10/10)
- **Temporal queries:** Excellent (10/10)
- **Email queries:** Strong (9/10)
- **Vague recall:** Strong (9/10)
- **Document queries:** Good (8/10)
- **Relationship recall:** Good (8/10)

**No critical issues found.** The system demonstrates robust handling of natural language queries with appropriate source selection. Minor improvements could be made for relationship origin queries (adding calendar/gmail for first interactions) but are not urgent.
