# Google Docs to Obsidian Sync Configuration
#
# This file defines which Google Docs should be synced to your Obsidian vault.
# Sync runs nightly at 3 AM Eastern as part of the regular sync.
#
# Copy this file to gdoc_sync.yaml and configure your documents.
#
# Each document needs:
#   - doc_id: The Google Doc ID (from the URL)
#   - vault_path: Path relative to your vault root
#   - account: "personal" or "work" (which Google account has access)
#
# To get the doc_id from a Google Docs URL:
#   https://docs.google.com/document/d/[DOC_ID_HERE]/edit
#
# Synced files will have:
#   - Frontmatter with sync metadata
#   - Warning callout with link to edit in Google Docs
#   - Converted Markdown content
